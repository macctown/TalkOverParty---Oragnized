# TalkOverParty---Oragnized
This is an one-time use web app. When people have plan to hangout, but have no idea about where (even what) to go. They can have real-time chat, real-time location, and intelligent recommendation according to their location, traffic (Google Map API) and place reviews data (Yelp API).

The stack is: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + MongoDB + Mongoose + (Angular.js => add in 2.0)

There are 2 versions before the one I'm going to work on:

1. Nov 2015 - Fully function of "Real-time Chat"
2. Feb 2016 - Fully function of "Location", "Use of Yelp API", "Polygon Search", "Basic UI". But failed due to no use of git and unkown bug happens.

Therefore, this version will be fully tracked on Github and more organizable than the version before.
